# 👋 Hi, I'm dragoncraft87

I'm a maker and system builder focused on **real, working projects** that combine  
**hardware, firmware, and web-based control interfaces**.

I don't chase green GitHub squares.  
I design systems, validate ideas, and turn them into something that actually runs.

## 🔧 What I do

- 🧠 **System & feature design**
  - defining functionality, workflows, and hardware interaction
- 🔍 **Debugging & problem analysis**
  - build errors, logic flaws, version conflicts
- 🤖 **AI-assisted development**
  - using multiple AI tools as accelerators and reviewers  
  - validating, testing, and refining results myself
- 🧩 **Hardware & embedded projects**
  - ESP32-based systems, displays, sensors, battery operation
- 🧱 **CAD & fabrication**
  - enclosure design, 3D printing, mounting solutions
- 🔌 **Hands-on work**
  - wiring, soldering, assembly
- 🎨 **Iterative UI/UX**
  - simple HTML mockups → refinement → functional interfaces

## 🧠 How I work

I focus on **clarity over volume**:
- I know what I want to build
- I can describe problems precisely
- I research and validate solutions
- I use AI as a tool, not as a replacement for thinking

If something runs reliably and is maintainable, it's a success.

## 📫 Notes

Most of my work lives in private repositories or on my workbench.  
Public repositories represent **polished or shareable parts** of larger projects.
